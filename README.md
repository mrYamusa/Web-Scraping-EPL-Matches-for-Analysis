# Web-Scraping-EPL-Matches-for-Analysis
This project involves creating a Python script to scrape match results from the English Premier League (EPL) using the requests library for data retrieval and Beautiful Soup for parsing HTML. The data is then organized into a pandas DataFrame for data cleaning and preparation for machine learning applications.
